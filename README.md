# Admission-Portal
This Admission Portal is a foundational project developed using Python and SQL, designed to manage student admissions efficiently. It supports functionalities such as student registration, data storage, record retrieval, and updating or deleting entries. The project integrates Python programming with SQL for seamless database management and demonstrates key skills in backend development and data handling.

Key Features:

1) Student Registration: Collects and stores student details in a structured database.
2) Record Management: Enables CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage admission data dynamically.
3) Search Functionality: Allows users to query specific records based on criteria.
4) Data Validation: Ensures input accuracy through Python-based checks.

Skills Demonstrated:

1) Python Programming: Implementing logic, user interface, and error handling.
2) SQL: Designing relational databases, writing queries, and managing data.
3) Database Connectivity: Using Python libraries like sqlite3 or MySQL for integration.
4) Modular Coding: Employing functions and reusable components for clean and maintainable code.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

1) Python: Functions, loops, exception handling, and file operations.
2) SQL: Query writing, table creation, and database operations.
3) Python Libraries: sqlite3 or other database connectors.

This project serves as a stepping stone for building more advanced applications and showcases the practical use of Python and SQL in creating functional systems.
